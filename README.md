# Hearts

A version of the hearts card game where players are trying to take the least number of hearts and the queen of spades in tricks unless they are able to take all 13 hearts and the queen of spades. This game is full of strategy and requires 3 to 4 people to play. Hopefully this version will get rid of the problem of not having enough players :)
