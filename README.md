# Hearts

A version of the hearts card game where players are trying to take the least number of hearts and the queen of spades in tricks unless they are able to take all 13 hearts and the queen of spades. This game is full of strategy and requires 3 to 4 people to play. This version gets rid of the problem of not having enough players :)

# Starting the Game

'''bash
iex -S mix
'''

If the game doesn't start immediately, type: 
'''elixir
Hearts.run()
